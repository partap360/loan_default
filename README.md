# Loan Default Prediction 
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan defaults using various classification algorithms. The dataset has significant class imbalance, the number of non-defaulted loans far exceeds the number of defaulted ones. To address this challenge, we have explored both undersampling and oversampling techniques to create a balanced dataset for model training and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a number of features related to loan applicants, including employment history, annual salary and bank balance. Each entry in the dataset is labeled as either 1 (Default) or 0 (Non-Default).

## Classification Algorithms

## Future Improvements
As a starting point, this project gives insights into default prediction with imbalanced datasets. Potential future improvements may include:\
Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.\
Experimenting with different feature engineering techniques.\
Exploring advanced resampling techniques.
